### Custom tradingview indicators 

These are the indicators I use in my trading system to simplify the process of trading. 

In my world there are three basic components of price action (volume, volatility and momentum) and I have distilled the elements of each into their own indicators, which I use for filtering for potential oportunities. 

I also rely on a combination of the following techical tools, all of which are rolled up in my HUD tradingview strategy,
- vwap (intraday, anchored)
- moving averages (weighted, hlc3)
- daily chart key technical levels
- recent intraday technical levels
- ATR extensions
